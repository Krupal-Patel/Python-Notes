# Simple TensorFlow Model: Code and Explanation

This guide presents a basic TensorFlow script that trains a model to learn the straight-line relationship `y = 2x - 1`, with the code and its explanation side-by-side.

## Code with Line-by-Line Explanation

```python
import tensorflow as tf

What it does: Imports the TensorFlow library, our toolbox for building and training machine learning models.

Simple terms: Like opening your kitchen cabinet to get all your cooking tools.

python

import numpy as np

What it does: Imports NumPy, a library for handling numbers and arrays efficiently—TensorFlow works well with it.

Simple terms: Like grabbing a calculator to help with math while cooking.

python

xs = np.array([-1.0,  0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype=float)

What it does: Creates an array of input data (x-values): -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. dtype=float ensures they’re decimals.

Simple terms: Lists the ingredients—your “x” numbers the model will learn from.

python

ys = np.array([-3.0, -1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0], dtype=float)

What it does: Creates an array of output data (y-values): -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7. These are the “correct answers.”

Simple terms: The results you want—like “when x is 2, y should be 3.”

python

model = tf.keras.Sequential([

What it does: Starts a simple model using Keras (part of TensorFlow). “Sequential” means layers stack one-by-one.

Simple terms: Like starting a recipe—step 1, step 2, etc.

python

    tf.keras.Input(shape=(1,)),

What it does: Defines the input layer, saying each data point is one number (shape=(1,)).

Simple terms: Tells the model, “expect one ingredient at a time” (e.g., just x).

python

    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)

What it does: Adds a “Dense” layer with 1 neuron. This learns a straight-line equation (y = mx + b).

Simple terms: The chef who mixes one input (x) to guess one output (y).

python

    ])

What it does: Closes the model definition—everything inside the brackets is set.

Simple terms: Says, “recipe done, ready to cook!”

python

model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')

What it does: Sets up the model with:
optimizer='sgd': Stochastic Gradient Descent to tweak weights slowly.

loss='mean_squared_error': Measures error by averaging squared differences.

Simple terms: Picks a coach (SGD) to fix mistakes and a scorecard (MSE) to track errors.

python

model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)

What it does: Trains the model with x’s and y’s for 500 rounds (epochs), adjusting weights to lower loss.

Simple terms: Practices the recipe 500 times—each time, the chef gets better.

python

print(f"model predicted: {model.predict(np.array([10.0]), verbose=0).item():.5f}")

What it does: 
model.predict(np.array([10.0])): Guesses y for x = 10.

verbose=0: Keeps it quiet (no extra output).

.item(): Extracts the single number.

:.5f: Formats to 5 decimals.

Simple terms: Tests the chef with x = 10 and prints the guess (should be ~21).

What’s Happening?
The Pattern: The data (xs, ys) follows y = 2x - 1 (e.g., 2*2 - 1 = 3).

Training: The model learns this line over 500 epochs.

Prediction: For x = 10, it predicts ~21 (2*10 - 1 = 21), showing it worked!

This is a great intro to TensorFlow—building a tiny model to learn a straight line from data.
