# Motion Charts

- The Pages shelf allows you to break a data visualization into a series of pages to view how a specified field affects the data. Think of the Pages shelf as a way of turning your visualization into a flipbook where each page is the same visualization filtered by a different value.
- When a dimension or measure is added to the Pages shelf, multiple visuals (pages) are created for each value within the specified field. Only one visual is visible at a time. You can access these visuals individually by using the Page Control interface, which appears on the right side of your visualization after adding a field to the Pages shelf.

## Dual Axis Chart
- In Tableau, there are two types of dual-axis charts: a single mark dual-axis chart and a combination mark dual-axis chart
