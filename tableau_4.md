# Table Organization
  - Filtering data to remove data that is unnecessary for your analysis.
  - Sorting data to adjust the order in which the data appears.
  - Enhancing tables by including subtotals and grand totals.

## Worksheet Filters
  Recall that there are two ways to filter your data.

  - **DATA SOURCE FILTERS:** These are used to filter data in the data source before the data gets to the worksheet. When a data source filter is used, it affects the entire Tableau workbook. Filtering the data source is useful when dealing with larger datasets because filtering out unneeded data helps improve the performance of your Tableau creations.
  - **WORKSHEET FILTERS:** These are used to filter data for a specific data visualization in a single worksheet. The data still exists in the data source — you have simply restricted which pieces of data appear in the visualization you're creating. You will use these often throughout your analysis to develop new perspectives of your datasets. While not an official name provided by Tableau, this course will refer to these types of filters as "worksheet filters," as you use them on a worksheet.

### Create Worksheet Filters
  - Creating filters in worksheets is very straightforward. Simply drag the dimension(s) and/or measure(s) you would like to filter to the Filters shelf. When you drag a new field into the Filters shelf, a dialog box will appear. Make your selections and voila — your data is filtered!

### Filter Views
  - Showing the filter is very easy. Simply right-click the pill for which you want to show the filter and select "Show Filter." Hiding the filter is just as easy — right-click the pill again and deselect "Show Filter."
  - To edit the filter view default format, navigate to the filter that has been displayed on the right side of the worksheet, click on the dropdown arrow, and select "Edit Filter."
