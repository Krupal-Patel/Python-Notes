## Anscombe's Quartet

Anscombe's Quartet is a famous example of why including data visualizations to support your insights is pivotal. This phenomenon happens all the time in data analysis. Take the dinosaur and the twelve data visualizations, for example. They all look entirely different — however, they share the same statistical data.

- Building data visualizations is an important step in the data analysis process and an important skill for business or data analysts to master. 
- Your data is only as good as your ability to comprehend and communicate it.
- Human brains process complex data better when it's displayed in visualizations — as opposed to numbers and text.
- The three data viz goals are exploring, explaining, and exhibiting.
- As a business or data analyst, you will be working primarily with exploratory and explanatory data visualizations.
- Exploratory data visualizations are used to better understand and make sense of the data you are working with.
- Explanatory data visualizations are used to help explain your insights to others.
- There are many tools that allow analysts to create data visualizations, including spreadsheet software. However, many employers specifically seek mastery of Tableau, which enables you to process, manipulate, and organize data into data visualizations.


## Tableau Public — a free platform that allows you to create and share data visualizations

- With spreadsheet software, you can clean and wrangle data as well as create data visualizations, but it does not allow for manipulation of large datasets. 
- With SQL, you can pull, store, and wrangle large data from databases, but you cannot create visualizations.
- With Tableau, you can pull data from databases, manipulate large datasets, and create data visualizations, but its data cleaning and wrangling capabilities are limited.

In general, if your data is relatively clean, then Tableau could be the only tool you use in your analysis, but you will more likely find yourself using Tableau alongside other tools.


## Datasource Page
### 1. Left Pane
The left pane is broken down into two main components: connections and sheets.

  - Connections: This contains information about the data source you're connected to. It will tell you the name of the data source as well as the data source type.
  - Sheets: This section of the interface displays all the sheets (also called tables) that are included within the data source.

### 2. Canvas
  - The canvas is where you choose and configure the tables you want to select for your analysis by dragging them from the left pane onto the canvas.

### 3. Metadata Grid
  - The metadata grid displays the fields in your data source as rows so that you can quickly examine the structure of your dataset and perform routine management tasks, such as renaming fields or hiding multiple fields at once.


### 4. Data Grid
  - The data grid is where you will see the configuration of the raw data you have created during your analysis. This area displays the first 100 rows of your data.
    - Field: A field is a column from your data source. From this point on, table columns will be referred to as fields.
    - Field name: Each field has its field name bolded at the top. This is a part of the Tableau header.
    - Table name: Each field indicates the table it belongs to above the field name. This is especially helpful when you're using multiple tables in your canvas.
    - Data type: Every field is automatically assigned a data type (e.g., numerical, date, geographic, etc.). You will learn about data types in more detail later in this certificate.

- Although Tableau is not the most robust tool for cleaning or wrangling your data, it does surpass other tools in its data exploration and interactive analysis abilities. This allows more time to focus on the inferences and insights produced from the data and less time on building or navigating a tool.

- Tableau is not as powerful as Excel when it comes to creating data, preprocessing data, and multi-layered calculations.
