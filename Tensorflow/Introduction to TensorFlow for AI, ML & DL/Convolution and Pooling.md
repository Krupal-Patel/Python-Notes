# Convolution
Convolution is a fundamental concept in mathematics, signal processing, image processing, and even machine learning (think convolutional neural networks!). At its core, convolution is a way to combine two functions to produce a third function that describes how one modifies or "interacts" with the other. Let me break it down step-by-step in a clear and intuitive way.

Simple Example (1D Convolution)
  - Let’s say we have:
    Input signal: [1, 2, 3, 4] (think of this as a sequence of numbers over time or space).
  
    Filter: [0.5, 0.5] (a simple averaging filter).
  
  - To compute the convolution:
    Start with the filter aligned at the beginning of the input: [0.5, 0.5] over [1, 2].
    Multiply: 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 2 = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5.
  
    Output: 1.5.
  
  - Slide the filter one step to the right: [0.5, 0.5] over [2, 3].
    Multiply: 0.5 * 2 + 0.5 * 3 = 1 + 1.5 = 2.5.
  
    Output: 2.5.
  
  - Slide again: [0.5, 0.5] over [3, 4].
    Multiply: 0.5 * 3 + 0.5 * 4 = 1.5 + 2 = 3.5.
  
    Output: 3.5.
  
    So, the convolution result is [1.5, 2.5, 3.5]. Notice the output is shorter than the input—this is typical unless we "pad" the input.

# Pooling

In CNNs, pooling is a step that comes after convolution. After the convolution layer uses filters to make a feature map (a grid showing where important stuff like edges or patterns are), pooling shrinks that map down. It’s like zooming out to see the big picture instead of every tiny detail. This makes the network faster, uses less memory, and helps it focus on the most important features without getting confused by small changes.
There are two main types: max pooling (picking the biggest value) and average pooling (taking the average), with max pooling being the most popular.
