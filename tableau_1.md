## Anscombe's Quartet

Anscombe's Quartet is a famous example of why including data visualizations to support your insights is pivotal. This phenomenon happens all the time in data analysis. Take the dinosaur and the twelve data visualizations, for example. They all look entirely different — however, they share the same statistical data.

- Building data visualizations is an important step in the data analysis process and an important skill for business or data analysts to master. 
- Your data is only as good as your ability to comprehend and communicate it.
- Human brains process complex data better when it's displayed in visualizations — as opposed to numbers and text.
- The three data viz goals are exploring, explaining, and exhibiting.
- As a business or data analyst, you will be working primarily with exploratory and explanatory data visualizations.
- Exploratory data visualizations are used to better understand and make sense of the data you are working with.
- Explanatory data visualizations are used to help explain your insights to others.
- There are many tools that allow analysts to create data visualizations, including spreadsheet software. However, many employers specifically seek mastery of Tableau, which enables you to process, manipulate, and organize data into data visualizations.
